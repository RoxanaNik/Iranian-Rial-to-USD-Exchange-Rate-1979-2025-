#  Visualizing the Iranian Rial to USD Exchange Rate (1979–2025)

Hi 
This is a little side project I built in R to animate the history of the Iranian Rial (IRR) against the US Dollar (USD) from 1979 all the way to 2025. The goal was to bring the data to life and show how the currency has changed (and inflated) over the decades — especially helpful for anyone curious about Iran's economic story through numbers.

##  What’s inside

This repo includes:

- A build in dataset of the average of IRR to USD exchange rates
- A full R script that builds and animates the plot using `ggplot2` and `gganimate`
- A `.gif` animation that shows the exchange rate evolving year by year on a log scale

The animated visualization of the Iranian Rial (IRR) to US Dollar (USD) exchange rate from 1979 to 2025 provides a striking representation of the long-term devaluation of Iran’s national currency. The exchange rate begins at approximately 70 IRR/USD in 1979, during the final year of the Pahlavi monarchy. Over the next decade, the rate remains relatively stable, suggesting a period of controlled or fixed currency valuation. However, a sharp and unprecedented increase is observed beginning in 1993, when the rate surges to over 1,500 IRR/USD. This sudden jump reflects the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq War and the introduction of a unified exchange rate policy, which exposed the local currency to market forces. From the early 2000s onward, the Rial’s value continues to decline steadily, but the most dramatic depreciation occurs after 2010. This period coincides with intensified international sanctions, reduced oil exports, and internal economic mismanagement. By 2025, the exchange rate surpasses 800,000 IRR/USD, representing an inflationary increase of several orders of magnitude. The use of a logarithmic scale in the plot is essential for visual clarity, as it allows the viewer to perceive both the early stability and the later exponential devaluation within the same frame. Overall, the animation captures not only numerical changes but also narrates a broader economic and political trajectory marked by prolonged inflation, external pressures, and internal instability.
